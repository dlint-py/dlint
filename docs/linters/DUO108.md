# DUO108

**Note: This rule only applies to Python 2**

This linter searches for use of the built-in `input` function. This function
is equivalent to `eval(raw_input(...))`, and thus commonly allows for arbitrary
code execution bugs when combined with user input.

## Problematic code

```python
input('Text here: ')
Text here: open('/etc/passwd').read()
```

## Correct code

```python
raw_input('Text here: ')
Text here: open('/etc/passwd').read()
```

## Rationale

Arbitrary code execution allows an attacker to perform any action within the
context of the system the bug is found. E.g. open a reverse shell to a system
of their choosing, install malware by downloading and running a payload,
silently log actions performed on the victim system, etc.

Arbitrary code execution bugs are effectively the keys to the castle. We'd
like to avoid using the above function because it commonly allows for these
types of bugs.

## Exceptions

- Code using `six.moves.input` behaves like Python 3 `input`, and thus is safe
