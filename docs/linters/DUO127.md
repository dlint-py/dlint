# DUO127

This linter searches for insecure use of the `duo_client` module.

More specifically, it searches for making insecure HTTP requests or
HTTPS requests with certificate verification disabled when communicating
with the Duo API.

## Problematic code

```python
import duo_client

client = duo_client.Client(ikey=..., skey=..., host=..., ca_certs="HTTP")
```

```python
import duo_client

client = duo_client.Client(ikey=..., skey=..., host=..., ca_certs="DISABLE")
```

## Correct code

```python
import duo_client

client = duo_client.Client(ikey=..., skey=..., host=...)
```

## Rationale

HTTPS with certificate verification enabled ensures your requests are
communicating with whom they're supposed to be. Without this there could be an
attacker impersonating the server you intend to be communicating with. To
prevent this you must ensure certification verification is enabled.

## Exceptions

- Code connecting to local development services or in test environments
