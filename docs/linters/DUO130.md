# DUO130

This linter searches for insecure use of the `hashlib` module.

More specifically this searches for MD5 or SHA1 use when hashing. Both of these
hashing algorithms are considered insecure at this point:

* [Is MD5 considered insecure?](https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/19906/is-md5-considered-insecure)
* [How secure is SHA1? What are the chances of a real exploit?](https://crypto.stackexchange.com/questions/48289/how-secure-is-sha1-what-are-the-chances-of-a-real-exploit)

## Problematic code

```python
import hashlib

md5_hashed = hashlib.md5(b"data").hexdigest()
sha1_hashed = hashlib.sha1(b"data").hexdigest()
```

## Correct code

```python
import hashlib

sha256_hashed = hashlib.sha256(b"data").hexdigest()
sha512_hashed = hashlib.sha512(b"data").hexdigest()
blake2b_hashed = hashlib.blake2b(b"data").hexdigest()

# Only supported in Python 3.9 and above
md5_hashed = hashlib.md5(b"data", usedforsecurity=False).hexdigest()
sha1_hashed = hashlib.sha1(b"data", usedforsecurity=False).hexdigest()
# ...
```

## Rationale

Some algorithms have known hash collision weaknesses.

## Exceptions

* Compatibility with systems that can only use MD5 or SHA1 and are not under your control
* Use cases that are related to checksumming, rather than cryptography.
