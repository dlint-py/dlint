# DUO121

This linter searches for use of the `tempfile.mktemp` function. This function
may introduce race conditions into your code which could negatively impact
security.

From the documentation:

> Use of this function may introduce a security hole in your program. By
> the time you get around to doing anything with the file name it
> returns, someone else may have beaten you to the punch. `mktemp()` usage
> can be replaced easily with `NamedTemporaryFile()`, passing it the
> `delete=False` parameter.  Function `mkstemp` with "s" is secure as well.

## Problematic code

```python
import tempfile

temp_filename = tempfile.mktemp()
```

## Correct code

```python
import tempfile

f = tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile(delete=False)
temp_filename = f.name
```

```python
import tempfile

fd, temp_filename = tempfile.mkstemp()  # "mkstemp" with "s"
```

Note that in both cases there is (1) an open file descriptor to close
and (2) a file to remove on disk.  Also note that `NamedTemporaryFile`
can be used as a context manager, e.g. using the `with` statement.

## Rationale

This function introduces a race condition between filename creation time and
file access time. Depending on the code using the created filename, there could
be security implications. For example, denial-of-service (DoS) and
time-of-check-to-time-of-use (TOCTOU) bugs. Consider a situation where a file
created using this function did not exist, but by the time the filename is used
the file exists. Code that tries to create a new file at this location could
crash and lead to a DoS.

## Exceptions

None
