# DUO106

This linter searches for insecure use of the `os` module.

Use of `system`, `popen`, `popen2`, `popen3`, or `popen4` commonly allows for
arbitrary code execution bugs when combined with user input.

Use of `tempnam` or `tmpnam` is vulnerable to symlink attacks. Consider using
`tmpfile` instead.

## Problematic code

```python
malicious_input = 'cat /etc/passwd'
os.system(malicious_input)
```

## Correct code

Instead of using the `os` module to execute commands, prefer to use the
`subprocess` module while ensuring `shell=False`.

See [Replacing Older Functions with the `subprocess` Module](https://docs.python.org/3/library/subprocess.html#subprocess-replacements).

Prefer `tmpfile` to `tempnam` or `tmpnam`.

## Rationale

Arbitrary code execution allows an attacker to perform any action within the
context of the system the bug is found. E.g. open a reverse shell to a system
of their choosing, install malware by downloading and running a payload,
silently log actions performed on the victim system, etc.

Arbitrary code execution bugs are effectively the keys to the castle. We'd
like to avoid using the above function because it commonly allows for these
types of bugs.

## Exceptions

- Code may be safe if data passed to `os.system` contains no user input
- Code may be safe if data passed to `os.system` is a constant string
