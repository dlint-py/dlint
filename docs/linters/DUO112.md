# DUO112

This linter searches for use of the `extract` or `extractall` methods
on `ZipFile` objects. Use of these functions allows for arbitrary file
overwrites.

## Problematic code

```python
import zipfile

def func():
    zf = zipfile.ZipFile()
    zf.extract()
    zf.extractall()
```

## Correct code

To ensure secure usage you must inspect the zipfile prior to extracting it

## Rationale

From the Python documentation:

> Never extract archives from untrusted sources without prior inspection. It
> is possible that files are created outside of path, e.g. members that have
> absolute filenames starting with `"/"` or filenames with two dots `".."`.

## Exceptions

- Extracting zipfiles from trusted sources
