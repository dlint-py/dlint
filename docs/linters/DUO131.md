# DUO131

This linter searches for insecure attribute use of the `urllib3` module.
Specifically, using the `disable_warnings` function. This function disables
warnings such as unverified HTTPS requests, HTTPS request without SNI
available, HTTPS request to a host with a certificate missing a SAN, etc.

## Problematic code

```python
import urllib3
urllib3.disable_warnings()
```

## Correct code

There is no correct usage of this function

## Rationale

Warnings produced by `urllib3` are intended to prevent the user from
performing insecure web requests (along with preventing other common,
non-security-related errors). Disabling this functionality allows for insecure
requests to go unnoticed.

## Exceptions

- Code connecting to internal network services (although these should strive for full HTTPS as well)
- Code connecting to local development services or in test environments
